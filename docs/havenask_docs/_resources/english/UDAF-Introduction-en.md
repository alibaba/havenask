### Built-in UDAFs



Havenask provides the following common built-in UDAFs:



- SUM: aggregates intermediate values and returns the sum of the values.

- AVG: aggregates intermediate values and returns the average of the values.

- MAX: aggregates intermediate values and returns the maximum value.

- MIN: aggregates intermediate values and returns the minimum value.

- COUNT: aggregates intermediate values and returns the number of entries.

- ARBITRARY: aggregates intermediate values and returns a random value. In most cases, this function is used to return the value of a field whose values are all the same. This function is called the IDENTITY function in other SQL engines.

- GATHER: aggregates multiple single values into one value.

- MULTIGATHER: aggregates multiple multi-value values into one value.

- MAXLABEL: aggregates intermediate values and returns the maximum value of the specified label.

```sql

SELECT brand, sum(price) FROM phone GROUP BY (brand) ORDER BY brand LIMIT 1000
