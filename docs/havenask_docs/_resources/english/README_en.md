### Get started

Before you get started with Havenask, make sure that Docker is installed and started.



#### Start a container

Clone a repository.

```

git clone git@github.com:alibaba/havenask.git

cd havenask/docker

```

Create a container. CONTAINER_NAME specifies the name of the container.

```

docker pull havenask/ha3_runtime:0.1

./create_container.sh <CONTAINER_NAME> havenask/ha3_runtime:0.1

```

If you cannot download the image because of unstable connection to Docker Hub, try Alibaba Cloud Container Registry.

```

docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/havenask/ha3_runtime:0.1

./create_container.sh <CONTAINER_NAME> registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/havenask/ha3_runtime:0.1

```



Log on to the container.

```

./<CONTAINER_NAME>/sshme

```



#### Build a test index



Build a full index.

```

cd ~/havenask/example/scripts

python build_demo_data.py /ha3_install

```



#### Test queries

Start Havenask.

```

python start_demo_searcher.py /ha3_install

```



Port 45800 is used by this engine in queries by default. Run the following sample script to test queries:  



```

python curl_http.py 45800 "query=select count(*) from in0"



python curl_http.py 45800 "query=select id,hits from in0 where MATCHINDEX('title', 'search dictionary')"



python curl_http.py 45800 "query=select title, subject from in0_summary_ where id=1 or id=2"

```
