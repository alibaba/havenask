### Description

You can use ORDER BY to sort one or more fields. The default value is ASC. ASC specifies the ascending order. When you sort data, use a LIMIT clause to improve the sorting performance.



### Syntax



```

select:

  SELECT [ DISTINCT ]

    { projectItem [, projectItem ]* }

  FROM tableExpression

    ORDER BY { orderByItem [ASC|DESC] [,OrderByItem ASC|DESC]* }

    LIMIT N

    OFFSET M

```



### Examples

1. Execute the following statement to sort data in a simple manner:



```

SELECT nid, brand, price, size FROM phone ORDER BY price LIMIT 1000

```



2. Execute the following statement to sort data in ascending order or descending order:



```

SELECT nid, brand, price, size FROM phone ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1000

```



3. Execute the following statement to sort multiple fields:



```

SELECT nid, brand, price, size FROM phone ORDER BY size DESC, price DESC LIMIT 1000

```



4. Execute the following statement to return the product records of the eleventh to twentieth prices in the price-based sorting result:



```

SELECT nid, brand, price, size FROM phone ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10

```



5. Execute the following statement to return the data of 10 random products without sorting the data:



```

SELECT nid, brand, price, size FROM phone LIMIT 10

```
