CASE WHEN expressions are similar to if...else statements. If the condition in a WHEN clause is met, the value in the corresponding THEN expression is used. If the conditions in all WHEN clauses are not met, the value in the ELSE expression is used.â€‹

# CASE-WHEN
## Syntax
```
CASE
WHEN conditon_1 THEN expression_1
WHEN conditon_2 THEN expression_2
...
ELSE expression_n
END
```

## Examples
1. CASE WHEN is used as an output expression.

```
SELECT  
    CASE    
        WHEN warehouse_id=48 THEN warehouse_id
        WHEN warehouse_id=24 THEN id
        ELSE wave_status
    END AS aa
FROM    s_wmp_package_wave
WHERE   wave_status = 0
LIMIT   10;
```

2. CASE WHEN is used as a conditional expression.

```
SELECT * FROM
(
  SELECT  
  CASE    
    WHEN warehouse_id=48 THEN warehouse_id
    WHEN warehouse_id=24 THEN id
    ELSE wave_status
  END AS aa
  FROM    s_wmp_package_wave
  WHERE   wave_status = 0
) t
WHERE t.aa > 10
LIMIT   10;
SELECT *
FROM s_wmp_package_wave
WHERE CASE
        WHEN warehouse_id=48 THEN warehouse_id
  WHEN warehouse_id=24 THEN id
        ELSE buyer_id
END > 10
AND wave_status = 0
LIMIT   10;
```

## Note
1. The values of all THEN and ELSE expressions must be of the same type.

2. CASE WHEN can be used only as an independent expression. It cannot be nested in other expressions or user-defined functions (UDFs). For example, the following CASE WHEN expression is not supported:

```
SELECT *
FROM s_wmp_package_wave
WHERE CASE
        WHEN warehouse_id=48 THEN warehouse_id
  WHEN warehouse_id=24 THEN id
        ELSE buyer_id
END + wave_status> 10
LIMIT   10;
```

3. CASE WHEN cannot be used for multivalued fields.

4. CASE WHEN must include ELSE expressions.
