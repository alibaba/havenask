# Common-Table-Expression
## Description
High-performance Search Edition support common table expressions (CTEs). You can create a CTE to specify a temporary result set that remains valid during the duration of a query. In SQL statements, you can reference the CTE to simplify the SQL statements. High-performance Search Edition supports CTEs in only SELECT statements.

The following sample code shows the syntax of a standard CTE:

```
WITH expression_name[(column_name [,...])]
AS
   (CTE_definition)
SQL_statement;
```

Specify a name for the CTE that you want to create. In an SQL statement, you can specify the name to reference the CTE.

Specify output fields in parentheses ().and separate multiple output fields with commas (,). Make sure that the number of output fields and the data types of the output fields are the same as the number of output fields and the data types of the output fields that you specify in the AS clause of the CTE. If you do not specify an output field in this expression, the system uses the output fields that you specify in the AS clause.

Then, an AS is used to define the data output clause of the CTE. The final output data of the CTE will be generated by this clause.

After you define a CTE, you can reference the CTE in SQL statements.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use a CTE.

```
WITH T_CTE (i1_cte,i2_cte) AS (SELECT i1,i2 FROM t1)
SELECT * FROM T_CTE
```

The preceding sample code shows how to define and use a simple CTE. The SELECT clause returns the result set based on the output fields that you specify in the CTE.

```
WITH T_CTE (i1_cte,i2_cte) AS (SELECT i1,i2 FROM t1)
SELECT * FROM t2 JOIN T_CTE ON t2.i1 = T_CTE.i1_cte AND t2.i2 = T_CTE.i2_cte
```

In the preceding sample code, a CTE is used in the JOIN clause.

```
WITH T_CTE (i1_cte,i2_cte) AS (SELECT i1,i2 FROM t1)
SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM T_CTE WHERE t2.i1 = i1_cte AND t2.i2 = i2_cte)
```

In the preceding sample code, a CTE is used in the sub-query statement.

## FAQ
### Performence

Based on the information provided in the "Overview" section of this topic, a CTE is used to define a temporary result set. During the process of statement execution, the system does not execute the CTE to obtain a result set before the system executes the SELECT statement. In the actual execution process of a statement that includes a CTE, the system obtains the information that you define in the CTE when the system generates an execution plan for the statement. Then, the system optimizes the SQL query based on the CTE and the SELECT statement in which you specify the CTE. The execution plan of a statement that includes a CTE is not more complex than the execution plan of a statement that does not include a CTE. The query performance of these types of statements is also the same.
